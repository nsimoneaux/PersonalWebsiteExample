  <h1 id="heading3of4">This is an example of a 3/4 website.</h1>

  <p>For this grade, I need to have 5 complete paragraphs of text. Each paragraph should be at least 4 sentences. Each 2/4 page should have approximately 20 sentences of information about your topic. Good luck!</p>
  <p>Many things you can write about are why your topic is important, who your target audience is, or other information that you may have collected. Make your website interesting! The hope is that people want to visit your site, and they enjoy it! Do good work!</p>
  <p>I am looking forward to grading all of your work, and hope you do well. It is very important that you work together, in order to accomplish all you can! I know I haven't discussed many of these topics in class, but I have shared this information with your classmates. You also have access to these examples!</p>
  <p>There is a lot of work that goes into a website. You need to create your HTML, develop your style sheet (CSS), collect your images, and have information. I know my students are capable of creating great work, and I am excited to see it. I also hope that my students' websites are informative to one another. I'm surprised no one made a website about how to make a website. That would be good.</p>
  <p>This is my final paragraph. When I complete this paragraph, I will have 5 paragraphs with text. These are beautiful sentences, and I look forward to reading yours. I think your websites will be very creative, and they will be on the internet for as long as you want -- share your sites with your friends! You have done good work, and you should be proud!</p>
  <p>Notice that my &lt;h1&gt; tag is using a custom google font.</p>
  <p><a href="3b.html">3/4 Website Part 2</a> -- Because the 3/4 requires multiple pages, my images and extra paragraphs are on the second page.</p>
  <p id="sentence2">This is my sentence with CSS ID styling.</p>
  <p>If you can complete this, I encourage you to move on to getting a 3/4.</p>
